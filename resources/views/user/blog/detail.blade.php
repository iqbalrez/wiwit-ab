                    The American Academy of Achievement members describe how they applied these six principles to their own lives
                    — passion, vision, preparation, courage, perseverance and integrity — to set them on to their individual paths to
                    success. Learn how these core principles helped our extraordinary leaders shape their achievements and their

                    We strive to capture the spirit of accomplishment and an appreciation for the character of eminent achievers.
                    Listening to their life stories, you can develop an awareness of the attributes these leaders share: The will to go
                    forward despite doubts, setbacks and ridicule. The ability to recover from failures and keep from becoming
                    discouraged. Courage, love and commitment to their work. The pursuit of excellence rather than a simple desire
                    for glory. By dedicating themselves to goals that aroused their passion, they often pushed the boundaries of
                    knowledge in their chosen endeavors. With these qualities firmly in hand, you may discover that you are already in
                    the middle of your own personal success story.
